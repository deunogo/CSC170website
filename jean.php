            <p>
                <strong>Jean-Michel Basquiat</strong> (French: [ʒɑ̃ miʃɛl baskja]; December 22, 1960 – August 12,
                1988) was an American artist of Haitian and Puerto Rican descent. Basquiat first achieved fame as
                part of SAMO, a graffiti duo who wrote enigmatic epigrams in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East
                Side of Manhattan during the late 1970s, where rap, punk, and street art coalesced into early
                hip-hop music culture. By the early 1980s, his neo-expressionist paintings were being exhibited in
                galleries and museums internationally. At 21, Basquiat became the youngest artist to ever take part
                in documenta in Kassel. At 22, he was the youngest to exhibit at the Whitney Biennial in New York.
                The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art in 1992.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basquiat's art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation,
                and inner versus outer experience. He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text
                and image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with contemporary critique.
                Basquiat used social commentary in his paintings as a tool for introspection and for identifying
                with his experiences in the black community of his time, as well as attacks on power structures and
                systems of racism. Basquiat's visual poetics were acutely political and direct in their criticism of
                colonialism and support for class struggle.
            </p>

            <h3>Criticism</h3>
            <p>
                In a review for The Telegraph, critic Hilton Kramer begins his first paragraph by stating that
                Basquiat had no idea what the word "quality" meant. <strong> WHICH HE DID!</strong> The
                criticisms which follow relentlessly label Basquiat as a <em>"talentless hustler"</em> and a
                "street-smart but otherwise invincibly ignorant" arguing that art dealers of the time were "as
                ignorant about art as Basquiat himself." In saying that Basquiat's work never rose above "that
                lowly artistic station" of graffiti "even when his paintings were fetching enormous prices,"
                Kramer argued that graffiti art "acquired a cult status in certain New York art circles." Kramer
                further opined that "As a result of the campaign waged by these art-world entrepreneurs on
                Basquiat's behalf—and their own, of course—there was never any doubt that the museums, the
                collectors and the media would fall into line" when talking about the marketing of Basquiat's
                name.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since his death at the age of 27 from a heroin overdose in 1988, his work has steadily increased in
                value. At a Sotheby's auction in May 2017, Untitled, a 1982 painting by Basquiat depicting a black
                skull with red and yellow rivulets, sold for $110.5 million, becoming one of the most expensive
                paintings ever purchased. It also set a new record high for an American artist at auction.
            </p>

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <Div>
                Basquiat's legacy has influenced literature, film, music, and fashion. In 2018, a public square in
                the 13th arrondissement of Paris was named Place Jean-Michel Basquiat in his memory. For the 2020-21
                NBA season, the Brooklyn Nets honored Basquiat with a basketball jersey inspired by his art.
            </Div>
            <h3>Fashion</h3>
            <p>
                In 2007, Basquiat was listed among GQ's 50 Most Stylish Men of the Past 50 Years. Basquiat often
                painted in expensive Armani suits and he walked the runway for the Comme des Garçons Spring/Summer
                1987 collection. To commemorate Basquiat's runway appearance, Comme des Garçons featured his prints
                in the brand's Fall/Winter 2018 collection. Valentino's Fall/Winter 2006 collection paid homage to
                Basquiat. Sean John created a capsule collection for the 30th anniversary of Basquiat's death in
                2018. Apparel and accessories companies that have featured Basquiat's work include Uniqlo, Urban
                Outfitters, Supreme, Herschel Supply Co., Alice + Olivia, Olympia Le-Tan, DAEM,and Coach New York.
                Footwear companies such as Dr. Martens, Reebok, and Vivobarefoot have also collaborated with
                Basquiat's estate.
            </p>
            <h3>Film</h3>
            <p>
                Basquiat starred in Downtown 81, a vérité movie written by Glenn O'Brien and shot by Edo Bertoglio
                in 1981, but not released until 2000. In 1996, eight years after the artist's death, a biographical
                film titled Basquiat was released, directed by Julian Schnabel, with actor Jeffrey Wright starring
                as Basquiat. David Bowie played the part of Andy Warhol. Schnabel was interviewed during the film's
                script development as a personal acquaintance of Basquiat. Schnabel then purchased the rights to the
                project, believing that he could make a better film.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2006, the Equality Forum featured Jean-Michel Basquiat during LGBT history month. A 2009
                documentary film, Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child, directed by Tamra Davis, was first
                screened as part of the 2010 Sundance Film Festival and was shown on the PBS series Independent Lens
                in 2011. Tamra Davis discussed her friendship with Basquiat in a Sotheby's video, "Basquiat: Through
                the Eyes of a Friend". In 2017, Sara Driver directed a documentary film, Boom for Real: The Late
                Teenage Years of Jean-Michel Basquiat, which had its world premiere at the 2017 Toronto
                International Film Festival. In 2018, PBS broadcast a 90-minute documentary about Basquiat as part
                of the American Masters series, entitled Basquiat: Rage to Riches.
            </p>
            <h3>Literature</h3>
            <p>
                In 1991, poet Kevin Young produced a book, To Repel Ghosts, a compendium of 117 poems relating to
                Basquiat's life, individual paintings, and social themes found in the artist's work. He published a
                "remix" of the book in 2005. In 1993, a children's book was released titled Life Doesn't Frighten
                Me, which combines a poem written by Maya Angelou with art made by Basquiat. In 2000, writer
                Jennifer Clement wrote the memoir Widow Basquiat: A Love Story, based on the narratives told to her
                by Basquiat's former girlfriend Suzanne Mallouk. The first American edition was released in 2014. In
                2005, poet M. K. Asante published the poem "SAMO", dedicated to Basquiat, in his book Beautiful. And
                Ugly Too. In 2016, the children's book Radiant Child: The Story of Young Artist Jean-Michel
                Basquiat, written and illustrated by Javaka Steptoe, was released in 2016. The biography, told from
                the perspective of a young prodigy, won the Caldecott Medal in 2017. In 2019, illustrator Paolo
                Parisi wrote the graphic novel Basquiat: A Graphic Novel, following Basquiat's journey from
                street-art legend SAMO to international art-scene darling, up until his death.
            </p>
            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>
                Shortly after Basquiat's death, guitarist Vernon Reid of New York City funk metal band Living Colour
                wrote a song called "Desperate People", released on their album Vivid. The song primarily addresses
                the drug scene of New York at that time. Vernon states that Basquiat's death inspired him to write
                the song after receiving a phone call from Greg Tate informing Vernon of Basquiat's death.
            </p>
            <p>
                On August 12, 2014, Revelation 13:18 released the single <em>"Old School"</em> featuring Jean-Michel
                Basquiat, along with the self-titled album Revelation 13:18 x Basquiat. The release date of "Old
                School" coincided with the anniversary of Basquiat's death. The single received attention after
                American rapper and producer Jay-Z dressed up as Basquiat for Halloween the same year as the release
                giving Revelation a nod. In April 2020, New York rock band the Strokes released their sixth studio
                album, The New Abnormal. The cover art featured Basquiat’s 1981 painting Bird on Money.

            <h3>SAMO graffiti</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="jean-images/samo.jpg" alt="Picture of Basquiat’s SAMO graffiti">
                <figcaption>Fig.4 - SAMO graffiti</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Basquiat began painting graffiti in the late 1970s, often socializing and working alongside other
                artists of the subculture in the Bronx and Harlem. Graffiti artists often focused on figurative
                jean-images (cartoonish pictures of animals, people and objects), as well as simple 'tags' - logos
                or names designed to be a trademark or calling card, which was were Basquiat also began. But
                Basquiat's graffiti quickly developed in a more abstract direction, with the "SAMO" tag origins
                quite mysterious and loaded with symbolism.
            </p>
            <p>
                This particular black spray paint tag on a wall is emblematic of the SAMO works that Basquiat and
                his collaborator Al Diaz made between 1976 and 1980. Quickly applied to public spaces in the street
                and subway, the SAMO pieces conveyed short, sharp and frequently anti-materialist messages to
                passersby. Usually seen as a sign of trespassing and vandalism, graffiti in the hands of Diaz and
                Basquiat became a tool of artistic "branding", and represents an important stage in the development
                of Basquiat's work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of SAMO, or <em>"Same Old Shit"</em>, was developed during Basquiat's involvement with a
                drama project in New York, where he conceived a character that was devoted to selling a fake
                religion. Diaz and Basquiat applied the implicit critique embodied by this snake-oil-salesman figure
                to the commercial and corporate enterprises that they saw hawking goods in public spaces across
                their city. They initially began to spray paint the slogans that made up the works across subway
                trains as a way of "letting off steam" but, as Diaz remembers, they rapidly realized that it
                fulfilled an important role when they compared the work to more conventional graffiti tags. As Diaz
                says, "SAMO was like a refresher course because there was a statement being made".
            </p>
            <p>
                After years of collaboration, Diaz and Basquiat chose to signify the end of their joint venture with
                the three-word announcement "SAMO IS DEAD". Carried out episodically in various cites as a piece of
                ephemeral graffiti art, the phrase surfaced repeatedly on gritty buildings, particularly those
                throughout Lower Manhattan, where much of the artistic scene Basquiat was part of was located.
            </p>
            <h3>Flexible</h3>
            <p>
                Flexible features two of Basquiat's most famous motifs: the griot and the venerable crown. A thin
                and emaciated black figure stares out from the canvas towards the viewer, its arms creating a closed
                circuit in what may be a reference to spiritualized energy, a concept which appears in several works
                featuring the griot.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whilst it's lack of distinguishing characteristics might imply an 'Everyman', the specifically
                African ethnicity of the figure provides a clear reference to Basquiat's own identity and
                background. In its color palette and the particular rendering of the human figure through thin limbs
                and a large head, the influence of the shapes and forms of traditional West African art is apparent.
                Art historian and Basquiat collaborator Fred Hoffman writes that the image represents a tribal king,
                one whose "posture, with arms raised and interlocked above his head, conveys confidence and
                authority, attributes of his heroism. The work also reflects Basquiat's development as an artist and
                is a synthesis of his influences, with the diagrammatic rendering of the figure's lungs and abdomen
                reminiscent of the young Basquiat's fascination with anatomical sketches from Gray's Anatomy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given that the griot is traditionally a kind of wandering philosopher, street performer, and social
                commentator, it is possible that Basquiat saw himself taking up this role within the New York art
                world, which nurtured his artistic success but also swiftly exploited it for material profit. The
                image is painted on wooden slats, which Basquiat asked his assistants to remove from a fence that
                protected the boundary of the studio where he was working in Los Angeles. By removing this barrier,
                Basquiat made the property open, and able to be traversed across freely, perhaps reflecting his
                empathy and personal experience of the limits of public space as a homeless person in New York.
            </p>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>Fig.5 - Flexible</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Heroes and Saints</h4>
            <p>
                A prominent theme in Basquiat's work is the portrayal of historically prominent black figures,
                who were identified by Basquiat as black heroes and saints. His early works often featured the
                iconographic depiction of crowns and halos to distinguish heroes and saints in his specially
                chosen pantheon. "Jean-Michel's crown has three peaks, for his three royal lineages: the poet,
                the musician, the great boxing champion. Jean measured his skill against all he deemed strong,
                without prejudice as to their taste or age," said his friend and artist Francesco Clemente.
                Reviewing Basquiat's show at the Bilbao Guggenheim, Art Daily noted that "Basquiat's crown is a
                changeable symbol: at times a halo and at others a crown of thorns, emphasizing the martyrdom
                that often goes hand in hand with sainthood. For Basquiat, these heroes and saints are warriors,
                occasionally rendered triumphant with arms raised in victory." Basquiat was particularly a fan
                of bebop and cited saxophonist Charlie Parker as a hero. He frequently referenced Parker and
                other jazz musicians in paintings such as Charles the First (1982) and Horn Players (1983), and
                King Zulu (1986).

            <h3>Riding with Death</h3>
            <figure>
                <img src="jean-images/riding-with-death.jpg" alt="Picture of Basquiat’s Riding with Death Painting">
                <figcaption>Fig.6 - Riding with Death</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Riding with Death is one of Basquiat's final paintings, and one which can easily be read as
                representing his inner turmoil and increasing conviction that the racist, classist, and corrupt
                nature of America in the 1980s was visible everywhere, including in the art world. Painted in the
                weeks before his death, the bleakness and sadness of the image and its title is only enhanced by the
                knowledge that the artist's life would come to an end far too soon shortly after its completion.

                The central figures, although simply framed, are loaded with symbolism. The pair suggest a nihilism
                or journey towards death that is made more poignant by Basquiat's dependence upon heroin and other
                drugs at the time of its painting. Although the African figure is riding the skeleton and could
                therefore be read as being in a position of dominance, the assertive positioning of the skeleton
                suggests instead that it is in control, perhaps dragging the rider to the far side of the frame.
                Coupled with the distinction in colour between the two (a white skeleton and Black rider), this
                couple could be read as a metaphor for the repression and destruction of African societies by
                colonial powers, as well as the inequalities that existed within 1980s America for people of color.
                This work is an excellent example of the complex meanings Basquiat was able to communicate and
                suggest through a complex visual language regularly referred to by critics as 'primitive' or
                'naïve'. As this poignant image shows, Basquiat's work was in fact highly sophisticated and far more
                technically accomplished than is often credited.
