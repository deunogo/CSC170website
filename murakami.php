            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <img class="scalabe" src="images/4.png" alt="Photo of Takashi Murakami">

            <p>Takashi Murakami (村上 隆, Murakami Takashi, born February 1, 1962) is a Japanese contemporary artist. He
                works in fine arts media (such as painting and sculpture) as well as commercial media (such as fashion,
                merchandise, and animation) and is known for blurring the line between high and low arts. He coined the
                term "superflat", which describes both the aesthetic characteristics of the Japanese artistic tradition
                and the nature of postwar Japanese culture and society, and is also used for Murakami's artistic style
                and other Japanese artists he has influenced. Murakami is also the founder and President of Kaikai Kiki
                Co., Ltd., through which he manages several youngee artists. He was the founder and organizer of the
                biannual art fair Geisa.</p>

            <h2>Life and career</h2>

            <h3>Academic background and early career</h3>

          

            <p>Murakami was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. From early on, he was a fan of anime and manga (Japanese
                comics), and hoped to work in the animation industry. He attended Tokyo University of the Arts to
                acquire the drafting skills necessary to become an animator, but eventually majored in Nihonga, the
                'traditional' style of Japanese painting that incorporates traditional Japanese artistic conventions,
                techniques and subjects. He earned his master's degree in 1988. Though he would go on to earn a Ph.D. in
                Nihonga (1993), he gradually became disillusioned with its insular, highly political world and started
                to explre more contemporary artistic styles, media, and strategies.</p>

            <p>Murakami was dissatisfied with the state of contemporary art in Japan, believing it to be "a deep
                appropriation of Western trends." Thus, much of his early work was done in the spirit of social
                criticism and satire. On an article naming and explaining all of Murakami's pieces lies the infamous My
                Lonesome Cowboy, a companion to his earlier Hiropon. The sculpture is that of a naked anime character
                with blond spiky hair with a spiral trail of semen circling him. This piece is Murakami's most expensive
                piece to date selling for $13,500,000 at Sothbye's New York auction in 2008. Efforts from this period
                include performance art (Osaka Mixer Project, 1992), parodies of the "message" art popular in Japan in
                the early '90s, (Dobozite Dobozite Oshamanbe, 1993), and conceptual works (e.g. Randoseru Project,
                1991). He also began developing his own pop icon, "Mr. DOB," which would later develop into a form of
                self-portraiture, the first of several endlessly morphing and recurring motifs seen throughout his work.
                Though he garnered attention, many of his early pieces were not initially well received in Japan.</p>

                <h3>New York</h3>

                <p>In 1994, Murakami received a fellowship from the Asian Cultural Council and participated in the PS1
                    International Studio Program in New York City for a year. During his stay, he was exposed to and
                    highly inspired by Western contemporary artists such as Anselm Kiefer and especially the
                    simulationism of artists such as Jeff Koons. He established a small studio, which, together with the
                    Hiropon Factory in Japan, became the precursor to his company Kaikai Kiki. After returning to Japan,
                    he would develop the core concepts behind his artistic practice and begin exhibiting regularly at
                    major galleries and institutions across Europe and America..</p>
   

            <h2>Superflat</h2>

            <p>In 2000, Murakami published his "Superflat" theory in the catalogue for a group exhibition of the same
                name that he curated for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. The theory posits that there is a
                legacy of flat, 2-dimensional imagery from Japanese art history in manga and anime. This style
                differentiates itself from the western approach in its emphasis on surface and use of flat planes of
                color. Superflat also served as a commentary on postwar Japanese society in which, Murakami argues,
                differences in social class and popular taste have 'flattened,' producing a culture with little
                distinction between 'high' and 'low'. The theory provided the context for his work and he elaborated on
                it with the exhibitions "Coloriage" (2002, Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain, Paris) and "Little
                Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture" (2005, Japan Society, New York). These helped introduce
                Japan's lesser-known creative culture overseas and such curatorial projects would become an integral
                part of Murakami's multifaceted artistic practice.</p>

            <h2>Collaborations</h2>

            <p>In 2002, at the invitation of designer Marc Jacobs, Murakami began his long-lasting collaboration with
                the fashion brand Louis Vuitton. He began by contributing artwork which was used in the design of a
                series of handbags. The series re-envisioned the company's monogram and was a huge commercial success.
                Though he had previously collaborated with fashion designers such as Issey Miyake Men by Naoki Takizawa,
                his work with Louis Vuitton made him widely known for blurring the line between 'high art' and
                commercialism. It also elevated him to celebrity status in his home country of Japan.</p>

            <p> In 2007, Murakami provided the cover artwork for rapper Kanye West's album Graduation and directed an
                animated music video for West's song "Good Morning". He also provided cover artwork for West's 2018
                collaboration album Kids See Ghosts with Kid Cudi. For "Graduation" and "Good Morning", Murakami would
                later 're-appropriate' these projects by incorporating their imagery into his paintings and sculptures,
                further blurring the boundaries between art and commercial branding and even questioning the existence
                of such a boundary.</p>

            <p>In 2009, music producer Pharrell Williams unveiled a collaborative sculpture with
                Murakami at Art Basel, which Williams stated "illustrates the metaphor of value."</p>

            <p>In 2018, Takashi Murakami collaborated with fashion designer Virgil Abloh on a series
                of artworks, bringing the fashion world to the art world but ultimately transcending both to create
                something more. Takashi and Virgil discuss their careers and their collaboration at length in their
                interview for Cultured Magazine's fall 2018 issue where they are featured on the cover.</p>


            <p>In March 2019, Billie Eilish released one of two official music videos for you should see me in a crown,
                one being directed and animated by Takashi Murakami. Murakami stated in a press release that the
                anime-style video, which was animated using motion capture technology, took eight months for him to
                create. The video opens with an animated version of Eilish, dressed in a neon-green shirt and shorts,
                eventually morphing into a spider-like monster that wreaks havoc on a miniature city. The video features
                the "Blohsh", Eilish's signature logo, as well as Murakami's flowers.</p>

            <p>In March 2020, J Balvin released his album Colores featuring album cover designs and artwork by Takashi
                Murakami. The Murakami-designed artwork was carried over to merchandise to celebrate the release of his
                album.In April 2020, Supreme released a Box Logo Tee featuring artwork from Murakami. All the proceeds
                went to HELP USA, in order to support youth and families facing homelessness during the COVID-19
                pandemic</p>

            <p>Asked about straddling the line between art and commercial products Murakami responded:</p>

            <p class="full-bleed quote ">“I don't think of it as straddling. I think of it as changing the line. What
                I've been talking about for years is how in Japan, that line is less defined. Both by the culture and by
                the post-War economic situation. Japanese people accept that art and commerce will be blended; and in
                fact, they are surprised by the rigid and pretentious Western hierarchy of "high art." In the West, it
                certainly is dangerous to blend the two because people will throw all sorts of stones. But that's
                okay—I'm ready with my hard hat.”</p>

            <h2>Art Style</h2>
            <p>Murakami's art encompasses a wide range of media and is generally described as superflat. It has been
                noted for its use of color, incorporation of motifs from Japanese traditional and popular culture,
                flat/glossy surfaces, and content that could be described at once as "cute", "psychedelic", or
                "satirical". Among his best known recurring motifs are smiling flowers, iconic characters, mushrooms,
                skulls, Buddhist iconography, and the sexual complexes of otaku culture. One of Murakami's most famous
                pieces known as 'Hiropon' brings to light his love for otaku culture. The sculpture that was created in
                2001 is said to show the "otaku culture and its strange, shocking sexuality in full force" and again
                like its counterpart 'The Lonesome Cowboy' semen rests floating around the female sculpture.</p>

            <p>In addition to large paintings such as 727 (permanent collection Museum of Modern Art, New York) and Tan
                Tan Bo Puking – a.k.a. Gero Tan, he has also produced sculptures, balloons, 'all-over' wallpaper
                installations, animated works, prints, posters, and assorted merchandise.</p>
